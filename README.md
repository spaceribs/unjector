# FCC Injector

Did you know that some of your customers have HTML injected into your website from their ISP? Some of the reasons
could include:
* Copyright infringement notices.
* Telling you that you have older (but compatible) modems or other equipment that comcast wants you to upgrade.
* Reaching the limit of your data cap.

It's appalling enough that Comcast is analyzing and injecting content into your webpage, if only there was a way
to fight back for the visitors of your website?
